# Summary
MicroRNAs are post-transcriptional fine-regulators. With a length of around 21 nucleotides, they form a RISC complex with a protein of the Argonaute family. This complex then binds the mRNA and promotes degradation or translational inhibition. It is now interesting to know the microRNA-mRNA pairs in order to infer dysregulating effects on the organism.

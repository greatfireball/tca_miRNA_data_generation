# NAME
parse_miRDeep2_output.pl
# VERSION
0.9
# DEPENDENCIES
- `Getopt::Long`
# DESCRIPTION
It takes the miRDeep2.csv output as source to detect missing annotations in the miRBase multi-fasta file of species_B. The miRBase mature.fa file of species_B is taken as reference. The script can then detect precursors with a missing arm annotation, in case the missing arm was found by miRDeep2. 

The script also takes precursor names with genomic copies in a comma-separated list as input. Those genomic-copy precursors share the same mature sequence and therefore, the script copies the mature sequences and renames them.
Duplicated genomic loci were named e.g. mir-11c-1,mir-11c-2. Their mature sequences on the other hand are named miR-11c-3p/-5p.
This script adds an addtional sequence for 11c-3p and 11c-5p and names the four mature sequences 11c-1-3p, 11c-2-3p, 11c-1-5p and 11-2-5p.
# PARAMETERS
none
# INPUT
- `mirdeep_bwt1.csv` := miRdeep2 output `.csv` file

- `<comma_list_of_precursor_copies>` := list of precurosors with genomic copy and identical mature microRNAs
# OUTPUT
A more complete set of mature microRNAs in multi-fasta file.

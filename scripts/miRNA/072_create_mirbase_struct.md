# NAME
072_create_mirbase_struct.pl
# VERSION
0.9
# DEPENDENCIES
- `RNA::HairpinFigure qw/draw/`
- `Getopt::Long`
- `File::Temp qw(tmpnam)`
- `RNAfold`
# DESCRIPTION
Folds the precursor sequence into a hairpin and format output like miRNA.str.
- Only mature sequences in hairpin are uppercase
- positions of mature sequences in the precursor are printed in the first line
- in case of a missing mature sequence, the miRNA.str entry was taken
# PARAMETERS
#### RNAfold
- `noPS` = no postscript drawing
# INPUT
- `-hairping` := miRNA mature multi-fasta
- `-mature` := miRNA precursor multi-fasta
- `-struct` := structure file from miRBase (miRNA.str)
# OUTPUT
- `custom.str`:= structure file, like miRNA.str, but with the novel microRNAs from previous analysis.
# CHANGELOG
- 2018-02-12 Release version 0.9
# KNOWN BUGS
no known bugs

# DEPENDENCIES
- `miRDeep2`

- `samtools` 
- `061_sam2de.pl` 

# DESCRIPTION
# PARAMETERS
#### bwa
- `index` := indexing the database (the mature microRNAs in our case)
- `aln`
  - `-n 1` := maximal difference
  - `-o 0` := maximum number of gap opens
  - `-e 0` := maximum number of gap extensions
  - `-k 1` := maximum differences in the seed
  - `-t 100` := threads
- `samse` := sai format to sam
- `xa2multi.pl` := belongs to bwa, creates additional lines for multi-mapping reads

#### samtools
- `view` 
  - `-F 4` := only include mapping reads


# INPUT
#### rna2dna.pl
- mature microRNAs of species_B
#### bwa index 
- mature microRNAs of species_B
#### bwa aln
- filtered and trimmed smallRNA data
- mature microRNAs of species_B bwa database
#### bwa samse
- `.sai` output of `bwa aln`
#### samtools view
- `.sam` output of `bwa samse`
#### xa2multi.pl
- mapping reads in `.sam` file of `samtools view`
#### 061_sam2de.pl
- mapping reads with multi-mapping reads, having a separate row in `.sam` file
# OUTPUT
#### rna2dna.pl
- mature microRNAs of species_B in DNA 

#### bwa index
- mature microRNAs of species_B in DNA as BWA database

#### bwa aln
`.sai` format of all reads against the microRNA database

#### bwa samse
`.sam` format of all reads against the microRNA database

#### samtools view
`.sam` format of all aligned reads against the microRNA database

#### xa2multi.pl
`.sam` format of all aligned reads against the microRNA database with every multimapping read in a separate row

#### 061_sam2de.pl
`.csv` format of all microRNAs with RPM expression

First row is header: rpm;condition;miRNA

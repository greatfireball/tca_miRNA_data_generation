# NAME
reformat_isomiRs.pl
# VERSION
0.9
# DEPENDENCIES
none
# DESCRIPTION
Takes the `miraligner` output `.mirna` as input. Each condition is run separately. Replicates are provided as comma-separated list.
`miraligner` checks for SNPs, templated additions at 5' and 3' end of the mature microRNA and non-templated additions to the 3' end.
If one type has no entry, the script writes a NULL (SQL-friendly). If all types are NULL, the supporting collapsed read is skipped, as there is obviously no modification.

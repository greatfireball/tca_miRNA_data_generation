# DEPENDENCIES
- `071_filter_fastq_N.pl`
- `072_create_mirbase_struct.pl`
- `073_seqbuster_pipe.pl`
- `074_reformat_isomiRs.pl`
- `wget`

# DESCRIPTION
- Filters all reads that contain 'N' characters in the sequence with `071_filter_fastq_N.pl`
- download `miRNA.str.gz` from miRBase
- gunzip `miRNA.str.gz`
- create miRBase structure file, according to `miRNA.str` from miRbase for the novel microRNAs. Use miRNA.str as reference for still incomplete miRNA precursors (missing mature sequence)
- run `miraligner`
- reformat the output to `.CSV` file for each condition and then merge all conditions into one `.CSV` file

# PARAMETERS
none
# INPUT
- trimmed and ncRNA-filtered small RNA sequencing data
- `miRNA.str` microRNA structure file from miRBase
# OUTPUT
# CHANGELOG

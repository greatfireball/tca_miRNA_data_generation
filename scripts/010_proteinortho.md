# NAME
010_proteinortho.pl
# VERSION
0.9
# Dependencies
- makeblast
- proteinortho5.pl
# DESCRIPTION
Computing blastp databases of both protein.fa files from species A and B. Then proteinortho detects orthologous genes between those two species.
Proteinortho automatically uses all available CPUs, but can be limited with `-cpus=` .
# PARAMETERS
`-clean`

`--project=output/folder/`
# INPUT
- species_A_protein.fa
- species_B_protein.fa
# OUTPUT
Tab-separated .proteinortho file:
- `Species` := number of species in this orthology group
- `Genes` := number of genes in this orthology group. Genes>Species indicates co-orthologs.
- `Alg.-Conn.` := algebraic connectivity
- `species_A_protein.fa` := proteinIDs involved from species_A
- `species_B_protein.fa` := proteinIDs involved from species_B

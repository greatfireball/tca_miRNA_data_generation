# NAME
bed2signal.pl
# VERSION
0.9
# DEPENDENCIES
none
# DESCRIPTION
Takes the `.bed` with the custom #4 column as input, together with the wanted signal strength (how many libraries have to support the genomic loci).
# PARAMETERS
none
# INPUT
- `file.bed`
- `<int_signal_strength>`
# OUTPUT
A `.bed` file that only contains those regions that have at least the given number of supportive libraries.

Adds additional information to column #4 : 

`length=<int>;subregion=<int>,<int>;originallength=<int>;originalbedline=<int>`
  - length := new length of region
  - subregion := string-substring indicator
  - originallength := original length of bed region from where this subregion was taken
  - originalbedline := the line number of the full-length region in the original bed file

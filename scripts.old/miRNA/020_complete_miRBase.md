# NAME
complete_miRBase.sh
# VERSION
0.9
# DEPENDENCIES
- `021_parse_miRDeep2_output.pl`
# DESCRIPTION
In some cases, miRBase entries are not complete. One arm is e.g. missing. Then sometimes miRBase simply calls the single arm miR-1 instead of miR-1-3p or -5p. This script tries to complete those missing miRbase entries by parsing the mining result of miRDeep2. Another case is that duplicated genomic loci were named e.g. mir-11c-1,mir-11c-2. Their mature sequences on the other hand are named miR-11c-3p/-5p. That means that for two precursor, we only have two instead of four mature sequences. Although they are identical, we need those sequence copies for our analysis. Therefore the user has to provide such cases.

# PARAMETERS

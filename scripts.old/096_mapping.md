# NAME
mapping.pl
# VERSION
0.9
# DEPENDENCIES
- `File::Temp qw(tmpnam)`
- `miranda`
# DESCRIPTION
Uses the miRNA set, mined in the other branch of this pipeline or a foreing set of microRNAs to predict their targets on the transfered CLIP-regions.
# PARAMETERS
#### miranda
- `quiet`
# INPUT
- `<mature_miRNAs.fa>` := mined microRNAs from other branch of the pipeline or foreign set of mature microRNAs
- `<transfered_clip_sequences.fa>` := A multi-fasta file of transfered CLIP sequences 
- `<outfile>` := output file
# OUTPUT
Tab separated result file with header line

- query_miRNA := microRNA name
- target_mRNA := header of transfered CLIP region (very long, as there is all information from needle inside)
- score := miranda scoring
- kcal/mol := binding energy
- Query-aln_start := start of alignment at query sequence
- Query-aln_end := stop of alignment at query sequence
- Subject-aln_start := start of alignment at target sequence
- Subject_aln-End := stop of alignment at target sequence
- Al-Len := length of alignment
- Subject-Identity := sequence identity in CLIP sequence
- Query-Identity := sequence identity in microRNA sequence

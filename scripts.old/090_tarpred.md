# NAME
tarpred.sh
# VERSION
0.9
# DEPENDENCIES
- `zcat`
- `bedtools`
- `095_csv_to_bed.pl`
- `096_mapping.pl`
# DESCRIPTION
Transforms the needle `.csv` output to bedformat, then merges overlapping regions and extracts the transfered CLIP `.fasta` sequence from the transcriptome. Finally a targetprediction on the transfered CLIP-regions with `miranda` is performed.
# PARAMETERS
#### bedtools
- `merge`
- `-c 4 -o collapse`
#### bedtools
- `getfasta`
# INPUT
- set of microRNAs, either from mining-branch of this pipe-line or from other sources
- needle output `.csv` file
- species_B_rna.fa
# OUTPUT
miranda targetprediction file
# CHANGELOG
